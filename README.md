## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding Project. 

In this project, I have build a Conversational Voice Controlled React News Application using Alan AI. Alan AI is a revolutionary speech recognition software that allows you to add voice capabilities to your applications. It allows you to control absolutely everything in the app using your voice. Another huge benefit is that it's extremely easy to integrate it. For this project I have used React.js, Materials UI and Alan AI for voice commands. I have fetched the news API from newsapi.org   

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` to start development server
